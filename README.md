Day 2 of our first Sensu Summit is an unconference style get together. We would love to capture people's experiences in this repo.

There will be a mix of sessions that are discussions and others that are working groups. If you're leading a discussion, please ask for a volunteer to act as Scribe. That person can either:

1. Share notes by creating a new markdown file named after the topic
1. Link to a public document (ex. Google Docs) in this README


### Thank You

We :heart: your participation and appreciate the unique perspective you bring to our community. Keep sharing in the #monitoringlove.
