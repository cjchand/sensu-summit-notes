Day 2 of our first Sensu Summit is an unconference style get together. We would love to capture people's experiences in this repo.

There will be a mix of sessions that are discussions and others that are working groups. If you're leading a discussion, please ask for a volunteer to act as Scribe. That person can either:

1. Share notes by creating a new markdown file named after the topic
1. Link to a public document (ex. Google Docs) in this README

## Sessions

_Here is where we'll list all sessions that took place during the event!_
